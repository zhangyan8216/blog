## Issue Analysis
The GitHub Actions deployment is failing with the error: "Branch 'main' is not allowed to deploy to github-pages due to environment protection rules." This means the GitHub Pages environment has protection rules preventing the main branch from deploying to it.

## Solution
We need to modify the environment protection rules for the github-pages environment to allow the main branch to deploy to it.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Access GitHub Repository Settings**:
   - Go to the repository settings page
   - Navigate to the "Environments" section
   - Find and select the "github-pages" environment

2. **Modify Environment Protection Rules**:
   - Remove any branch protection rules that are blocking the main branch
   - Ensure the main branch is allowed to deploy to the github-pages environment
   - Save the changes to the environment settings

3. **Trigger a New Deployment**:
   - Make a small change to the repository (e.g., update README.md)
   - Push the change to the main branch
   - This will trigger a new GitHub Actions deployment

4. **Verify the Deployment**:
   - Check the GitHub Actions workflow status
   - Verify that the deployment completes successfully
   - Test access to the GitHub Pages URL

## Expected Result
After modifying the environment protection rules, the main branch will be allowed to deploy to the github-pages environment, and the GitHub Actions deployment will complete successfully. Your blog will then be accessible at the GitHub Pages URL.
