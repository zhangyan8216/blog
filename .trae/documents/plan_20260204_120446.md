## Issue Analysis
The GitHub Actions deployment is failing with the error: "An error occurred trying to start process '/usr/bin/bash' with working directory '/home/runner/work/personal-blog-frontend/personal-blog-frontend/./frontend'. No such file or directory"

This happens because the workflow file is configured to use `./frontend` as the working directory, but the repository structure on GitHub has all files directly in the root directory, not in a `frontend` subdirectory.

## Solution
Update the GitHub Actions workflow file to use the root directory as the working directory instead of `./frontend`:

1. **Modify the workflow file**:
   - Remove `working-directory: ./frontend` from the install dependencies step
   - Remove `working-directory: ./frontend` from the build step
   - Update the artifact path from `./frontend/dist` to `./dist`

## Implementation Steps
1. **Edit .github/workflows/deploy.yml**:
   - Remove working directory specifications from all steps
   - Update the artifact path to use the root directory

2. **Push the changes**:
   - Commit the updated workflow file
   - Push the changes to the main branch
   - This will trigger a new GitHub Actions deployment

3. **Verify the deployment**:
   - Check the GitHub Actions workflow status
   - Verify that the application is accessible at https://zhangyan8216.github.io/personal-blog-frontend/

## Expected Result
After making this change, the GitHub Actions deployment should succeed, and the blog application should be accessible at the GitHub Pages URL with all assets correctly loaded.
